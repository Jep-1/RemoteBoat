# RemoteBoat

This is the code for my winning (hooray!) submission to the 2023 TigerHacks competition. 

Using two ESP32's, I configured them to talk to each other over a wireless server established by the "remote". It allowed the remote to talk to the client (or the boat) and send values wirelessly to the onboard DC and servo motors. 

**TL;DR It's a 3D printed remote control boat.**
